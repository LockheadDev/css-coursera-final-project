                        These programs read aloud the text displayed on the screen, helping users who are blind or have
                        low
                        vision navigate and interact with their computer. They can describe everything from website
                        content
                        and emails to application menus and documents. Examples include JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. They
                        also
                        provide keyboard shortcuts for navigating without a mouse.

                        These tools convert spoken words into text, allowing users to dictate documents, control
                        applications, and navigate their computer hands-free. This is especially useful for users with
                        mobility impairments who find typing challenging. Examples include Dragon NaturallySpeaking and
                        Windows Speech Recognition. They can also execute commands, like opening programs or browsing
                        the
                        web, through voice instructions.

                        TTS software converts written text into spoken words, making it easier for users with reading
                        difficulties or visual impairments to consume written content. Applications like NaturalReader
                        can
                        read out loud documents, web pages, and emails. Users can adjust the reading speed, choose
                        different
                        voices, and listen to text instead of reading it, which can also be beneficial for multitasking.
